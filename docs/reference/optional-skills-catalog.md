# Optional Skills Catalog

Optional skills ship with hermes-agent underoptional-skills/but arenot active by default. Install them explicitly:

`optional-skills/`

```
hermes skills install official/<category>/<skill>
```

For example:

```
hermes skills install official/blockchain/solanahermes skills install official/mlops/flash-attention
```

Each skill below links to a dedicated page with its full definition, setup, and usage.

To uninstall:

```
